PROJECT 1 - SQL DATA EXPLORATION 
My first Data Analysis project is exploring global data on confirmed COVID-19 deaths and vaccination roll out. 
I used both, excel and sql to format and query the data. 
I downloaded the csv  file from  Coronavirus (COVID-19) Deaths - Our World in Data. 
I also split the data into two tables. First has our death information, second includes vaccination information.
I created the Portfolio Project database where I put these two excel files ( I am using MySQL Workbench 8.0)
